Hide Coordinates
================
Server-side Fabric mod to prevent sending coordinates to the client. Based on and partly copied from the Spigot version CoordinateOffset by [Joshua Prince](https://github.com/joshuaprince).

This mod doesn't have all the features and may be sloppily coded. I needed it for a server I'm working on and figured that it might be useful to others.
The main feature missing here from CoordinateOffset is configuration. Offsets are always set so you spawn in chunk 0,0 and this resets on death and dimension change.
